# Bubble Chart

Bubble is a small repository implementing a bubble chart made with D3.js. The data are manipulated using R and then converted into .json format. 

The chart represents the imports and average tariffs of the different WTO members for the year 2013-2014 (depending on data availability). 

In order to start playing with data charts:

1. Clone the repository,
2. Locate file index.html,
3. Open it with your favorite web browser (Preferably Chrome or Firefox).
