Bubble Chart
============

Bubble is a small repository implementing a bubble chart made with D3.js. The data are manipulated using R and then converted into .json format.

The chart represents the imports and average tariffs of the different WTO members for the year 2013-2014 (depending on data availability).

In order to start playing with data charts:

1.  Clone the repository,
2.  Locate file index.html,
3.  Open it with your favorite web browser (Preferably Chrome or Firefox),

or simply click here: [Bubble Chart](https://marcgumowski.github.io/Bubble/).
