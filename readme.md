Bubble Chart
============

Bubble is a small repository implementing a bubble chart made with D3.js. The data are manipulated using R and then converted into .json format.

The chart represents the imports and average tariffs of the different WTO members for the year 2013-2014 (depending on data availability). Trade statistics used to build the dataset come from the World Tariff Profile 2016 publication and can be found in the databases of the WTO, ITC or UNCTAD. More information on the WTO web site: [Statistics](https://www.wto.org/statistics).

In order to start playing with data charts:

1.  Clone the repository,
2.  Locate file index.html,
3.  Open it with your favorite web browser (Preferably Chrome or Firefox),
